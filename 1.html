<h2>Corinthians 8:13</h2>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,</p>

    <p>Today, let us turn our attention to 1 Corinthians 13:8-13, where we read about the characteristics of love.<br> This passage is often referred to as the "Love Chapter" and is one of the most famous passages in the Bible.</p>
    
    <p>In verse 8, it says <strong><u>"Love never fails."</u></strong> Love is a powerful force that lasts forever, even when everything else has failed. <br>It is the one thing that will endure and stand the test of time.</p>
    
    <p>Verse 9 says "For we know in part and we prophesy in part." In other words, our understanding of things is limited and imperfect. We may have knowledge and understanding of some things, but we cannot have complete knowledge and understanding of everything.</p>
    <p>Verse 10 says "But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away." This refers to the time when we will have complete knowledge and understanding of all things, when we will be in the presence of God and will know him fully.</p>
    
<p>In verses 11-12, it says "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.<br> For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face.Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known." <br>Just as we grow and mature in our understanding of things, so too will our understanding of love grow and mature.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, in verse 13, it says "And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love." Love is the most important of the three because it is the one thing that will endure and last forever.</p>
    
   <p> In conclusion, let us strive to live a life of love, putting aside our childish ways and growing in our understanding of love, just as we grow and mature in all other aspects of our lives. Let us always remember that love never fails and that it is the greatest of all things.<br> May God bless you and may his love be evident in all that you do. Amen.</p><img src="cor.jpg"width="50%">
